![Unite by STEP](https://github.com/googleinterns/step128-2020/blob/master/src/main/webapp/images/uniteLogo.png)

Unite by STEP is a centralized platform for creating, sharing, and finding events relating to social good.  

Our focus is on accessibility and ease of use in order to reach the largest audience possible and allow them to engage in movements they care about. We hope that users will be able to make a real difference in their local communities, one step at a time.
